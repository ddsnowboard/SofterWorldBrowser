#SofterWorldBrowser
===========

This will be a webapp that lets you browse A Softer World in a more ergonomic way than the website allows. The website is nice, but it requires the use of the mouse, and it isn't very fast. This website will let you browse the whole comic, titles included, really fast, by only using the keyboard. 

It will be similar to SMBC in function; there will be keyboard shortcuts to go forward, backward, random, and to show the title (I don't think that SMBC actually has this for the votey). The only think on the screen will be buttons, which have their keyboard shortcut next to them, the comic image, and the title if it has been shown. When you click to move to a different comic, the title will disappear, if it was shown, and the next comic will show up. 

That stuff's boring. This site's real party trick is that this is all done asynchronously with JavaScript so it is insanely fast. When you first boot up the site, it will show the newest comic, and as soon as it's done downloading all the stuff that needs to be shown immediately, it will start prefeching stuff. The last time I did this, I made it download the images and put them into a div that was 0 x 0 and invisible so that they would be cached but invisible. That way, you can click on a button, and the next one will pop up almost instantly. I think I will do the same thing with this, if possible. The plan is that the website will call home with an XHR asking for a certain comic by number. The server will, with PHP, go to the Softer World server, parse the page, get the image URL (because that is not obvious from the comic number, by their scheme), get the title, and send all that back to the client, who will them download the image file, cache it, and then put everything in a big object so that it can be picked up whenever necessary. It will first go get the one previous and next to the one that is showing, and then it will pick a random number and go get that one. If a random comic is picked, instead of generating a random number on the spot, it will use this number and get this pre-fetched comic.
